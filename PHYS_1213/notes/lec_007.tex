\subsection{Current Definition and Formula}
\label{ssec:currentDefinitionAndFormula}

\begin{definition}{Current}
  Current describes how much charge moves past some spot over any given second.
\end{definition}

\begin{formula}{Current}
  \begin{align*}
    I &= \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{dQ}{dt} \\
    \textup{Ampere} &= \frac{\textup{Coulomb}}{\textup{Second}}
  \end{align*}
\end{formula}

Current has a direction. The direction of it is just convention, but is such that a \textbf{positive}
current corresponds to negative charges moving in the negative direction or positive charges
are moving in the negative direction.

Currents are created by \textbf{electric fields}, which can be conceptualized by a difference
in electric potential (voltage).

\subsection{Current at a Specific Point}
\label{ssec:currentAtASpecificPoint}

Inside a wire, each particle is moving \textit{on average} with some velocity in some direction.
This average \textbf{drift velocity} ($v_d$) of the particles is what determines the current of the
circuit.

\begin{formula}{Current by Volume}
  \begin{align*}
    \Delta L &= v_{d} \Delta t \\
    I &= nv_{d}Aq \\
    J &= \frac{I}{A} = nv_{d}q
  \end{align*}
  \begin{tblr}{ccccc}
    $I= $ current & $n=$ particle density & $v_d= $ velocity & $A= $ area & $q=$ charge \\
  \end{tblr}
\end{formula}

Different materials allow particles to move through them with varying ease. This property
is called the conductivity of the material.
\begin{definition}{Conductivity}
  Describes how easily a particle can move through a material. Denoted as $\sigma$.
\end{definition}
The conductivity of a material is empirically derived, but conceptually can be thought of
as the amount of obstacles in the way of a particles movement. The "denser" the path is,
the harder it is for a particle to move through the material.
\begin{formula}{Energy in Terms of Conductivity}
  \begin{align*}
    J &= \sigma E \\
    J \frac{1}{\sigma} &= E \\
    J \rho &= E
  \end{align*}
  \begin{tblr}{c|c}
    $J = \textup{current density} = \frac{A}{m^2}$ & $\sigma = \textup{conductivity} = \frac{A}{Vm}$ \\
    $E = \textup{electric field} = \frac{N}{C}$ & $\rho = \textup{resistivity} = \frac{Vm}{A}$ \\
  \end{tblr}
\end{formula}

\subsection{Ohm's Law}
\label{ssec:ohmsLaw}

\begin{formula}{Ohm's Law}
  \begin{equation*}
    J = \frac{E}{\rho} \ \ \Rightarrow\ \  \frac{I}{A} = \frac{\frac{\Delta V}{L}}{\rho} \ \ \Rightarrow\ \  \Delta V = \frac{\rho L}{A}I
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{tblr}{c|c}
    $I = \textup{current} = A$ & $A = \textup{area} = m^2$ \\
    $\Delta V = \textup{voltage drop} = V$ & $L = \textup{length} = m$ \\
  \end{tblr}
  \vspace{12pt}

  $\frac{\rho L}{A}$ are all constants, and are thus combined into a single constant: resistance ($R$).
  \begin{equation*}
    \Delta V = IR
  \end{equation*}
\end{formula}

Ohm's Law provides an alternative way to calculate energy within a circuit in terms of
voltage, current, and resistance.
Notably, Ohm's law is not a law of nature, but only applies to certain "ohmic" materials. In
terms of \textbf{resistance}, it is measured in Ohms ($\Omega$) with units in $\frac{V}{A} = \frac{Js}{C^2}$.

The amount of resistance is dependent on its resistivity/conductivity. However, that's not
the only thing it is related to. The size and shape of the conductor also play a role in
its resistance. Since:
\begin{equation*}
  R = \frac{\rho L}{A}
\end{equation*}
An increase in length corresponds to an \textit{increase} in resistivity. Conversely, an increase in
area of the cross-section of the conductor would correspond to a \textit{decrease} in
resistivity.

  \label{fig:028}
\end{wrapfigure}

As a current travels across a resistor, there is a voltage drop. This is seen in Ohm's Law,
where the voltage drop ($\Delta V$) is equal to the product of the current ($I$) and the
resistance ($R$).
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta V = IR
\end{equation*}
The larger the current or resistance in the resistor, the larger the voltage drop will be.
This voltage drop is a loss of energy within the system. So where does the energy go?

\subsection{Dissipated Heat}
\label{ssec:dissipatedHeat}

When a voltage drop occurs over a resistor, energy is lost. That energy transforms into \textbf{heat}. To measure
the heat power dissipated by a resistor:

\begin{formula}{Heat}
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{J}{s} = IV = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}
  \end{equation*}
\end{formula}

Since the resistance of a material can only be reliably calculated in the ways outlined
within the scope of PHYS 1213 for Ohmic materials, $I^2R$ and $\frac{V^2}{R}$ only apply
to Ohmic materials. However, $IV$ applied universally since it is not based on resistance.

\subsection{Current Throughout a Circuit}
\label{ssec:currentThroughoutACircuit}

  \caption{Charge in a Circuit}
  \label{fig:027}
\end{wrapfigure}

Current is just a measurement of how the physical electrons/protons in a circuit are \textbf{moving}
about. The movement of these particles depends on the amount of energy they have (voltage).

Current throughout a circuit is conserved. In other words, at any point, the total amount
of current flowing into a location must be the same as the amount flowing out of that
location.

In Figure \ref{fig:027}, the amount of current flowing into junction $A$ is always going
to equal the amount of current flowing out. In other words: $\overrightarrow{I_1} = \overrightarrow{I_2} + \overrightarrow{I_3}$.

  \label{fig:029}
\end{figure}

Considering the circuit in Figure \ref{fig:029} in terms of \textit{energy}, the energy of
the circuit is being supplied at the battery. The energy then travels through the circuit.
At each resistor, some amount of energy is being \textit{lost} in the form of heat. Over a
capacitor, the energy is charging up the capacitor to be stored in the form of potential
energy.

Importantly, no current is flowing across a capacitor, there is only a voltage drop across
them.

The voltage supply in a circuit is referred to as "emf", denoted as $\epsilon$.
